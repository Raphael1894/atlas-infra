## ðŸ“¦ Homepage shows less free disk space than expected

**Symptom:**  
Homepage shows only ~90 GB free, but your SSD is 512 GB.  

**Cause:**  
By default, Ubuntu LVM only allocates ~100 GB to `/` (root).  
The rest of the SSD is unallocated inside the volume group.  

**How to check:**  
Run:
```bash
df -h
```
If `/` (root) is around 100 GB, youâ€™re affected.

**Solution:**  
Expand the root volume to use the rest of the SSD:

```bash
# 1. Check how much free space is in the volume group
sudo vgdisplay

# 2. Expand root logical volume to use all free space
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv

# 3. Resize the filesystem
sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv

# 4. Verify
df -h
```

Now `/` should show close to your full SSD size.
