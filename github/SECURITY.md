# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Atlas Infra is provided **as-is** and without active maintenance.  
There are **no supported versions** — this is a community-driven, open-source project.  

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, you may:

- Open an **Issue** in the [GitHub repository](../../issues).  
- Or, if you prefer privacy, you may contact the repository owner via GitHub profile.  

⚠️ Please note:
- The repository owner does **not** guarantee fixes or patches.  
- This project is shared for educational and homelab purposes only.  
- You are free to fork and patch vulnerabilities yourself under the terms of the license.  

## Recommendations
- Always run Atlas in a **LAN or VPN-protected environment** (e.g., Tailscale).  
- Do **not expose services directly to the public internet** unless you have applied additional hardening.  
- Regularly update your Ubuntu host, Docker, and dependent images to benefit from upstream fixes.  

## Disclaimer
This project comes with **no warranties**.  
Security issues may or may not be addressed by the community.  
Use at your own risk.
