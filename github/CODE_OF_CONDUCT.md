# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being respectful and inclusive
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior.  

Since this project is shared *as-is* and not actively maintained, enforcement may be handled by community volunteers.  

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies in project spaces and when individuals are representing the project in public spaces.  

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an Issue or Discussion on GitHub.  

If you prefer not to use GitHub Issues, you may fork the project and continue work under your own governance.  

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
